##### GEOMETRIC DATA
# The domain can be 2D or 3D
TYPE_DOMAIN = 2D

# Poinst used to create the axis of the domain, the order is x, y, z
# The numeration of the firt element must be 1 and it has to be in ascending order with and increment of +1
# If it is a 2D problem the coordinate z must be 0

POINT(1) = (0, 0, 0)
POINT(2) = (10, 0, 0)
#POINT(3) = (1.2, -0.2, 0)

# Size (meters) between two consecutive points fo the mesh. The size is equal in all directions 
SIZE = 0.0005

##### DIMENSIONS OF THE CROSS DRAINAGE WORK (CDW)

# Points of geometric data that they are the initial and the end points of the shapes
INITIAL_POSITION_SHAPES = 1
END_POSITION_SHAPES = 2
# Shape of the CDW . It can be CIRCLE or RECTANGLE
CDW(1).type = CIRCLE

# Height and width in meters. Only used when the shape is RECTANGLE and the variable width is only used when the case is 3D
CDW(1).height = 1
CDW(1).width = 1 

# Radius in meters. Only used when the shape is CIRCLE
CDW(1).radius = 0.1

# Separation between CDW in meters. It is the distance between consecutive centers (Only used in 3D)
SEPARATION = 2

##### OBSTACLES

# CSV file. The seperator must be ; and the order of the coordinates in the column is x;y;z.
# there may be whitespaces, they are not taken into account, e.g. x ; y ; z
# To know if the nodes of the domain are inside the csv obstacle, it is necessary that the contiguos points form edges of the obstacle
# Types -> CSV_2D, WALL, CIRCLE
#OBSTACLE(1).type = CSV_2D # csv of a 2D obstacle
#OBSTACLE(1).name = nacca4412 # it is not necessary the extension .csv 
#OBSTACLE(1).position = (8, 1, 0) # x, y, z (meters) of geometric center
#OBSTACLE(1).rotation = (0, 0, 0) # Around its geometric center in Sexadecimal degrees and anticlockwise

#OBSTACLE(1).type = WALL
#OBSTACLE(1).position = (0.45, 0.05, 0) # x, y, z (meters) of geometric center
#OBSTACLE(1).height = 0.1 # in direction y

#OBSTACLE(1).zWidth = 0.2 # Only used in 3D
